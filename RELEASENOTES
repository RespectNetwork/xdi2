release 0.8 ("OrÈ™ova")
========================

* xdi2.core.features.nodetypes.XdiMember -> xdi2.core.features.nodetypes.XdiInstance

* xdi2.core.features.nodetypes.XdiMemberOrdered -> xdi2.core.features.nodetypes.XdiInstanceOrdered

* xdi2.core.features.nodetypes.XdiMemberUnordered -> xdi2.core.features.nodetypes.XdiInstanceUnordered

* In xdi2.core.features.nodetypes.XdiCollection and subclasses, changed various ..Member.. methods to ..Instance..

release 0.7 ("Belgrade")
========================

* Removal of the & value node:
The XdiValue class is removed. The Literal class has been renamed to LiteralNode. 
The ContextNode and LiteralNode classes now share the common Node interface. Many
other classes related to serialization, graph storage, and messaging have been
adapted to these changes. 

* Support for encryption and signatures:
xdi2.core.features.encryption
xdi2.core.features.signatures

* XDIAuthenticationConstants.XDI_ADD_ANONYMOUS -> XDIMessagingConstants.XDI_ADD_ANONYMOUS

* Timestamps.setContextNodeTimestamp() -> Timestamps.setTimestamp()

* XDIConstants.XDI_ADD_VARIABLE -> XDIConstants.XDI_ADD_COMMON_VARIABLE

* Updated variable support in parser and class hierarchy; variables are now nested classes.

* Remove XDIAddressUtil.findXDIAddress(), introduced XDIAddressUtil.extractXDIAddress()

* Literal -> LiteralNode, and implements Node

* setDeepRelation, setDeepLiteral, etc removed, instead do setDeepContextNode(..).setRelation(..)

* To move away from old "XRI" terminology, classes were renamed, e.g.:
XDI3Segment -> XDIAddress
XDI3SubSegment -> XDIArc
XDI3Statement -> XDIStatement

* To move away from old "XRI" terminology, methods were renamed, e.g.:
Message.setLinkContractXri() -> Message.setLinkContractXDIAddress() 

* To move away from old "XRI" terminology, constants were renamed, e.g.:
XRI_S_* -> XDI_ADD_*
XRI_SS_* -> XDI_ARC_*

* Use of the URL class instead of String in discovery:
String xdiEndpointUri = xdiDiscoveryResult.getXdiEndpointUri();
->
URL xdiEndpointUrl = xdiDiscoveryResult.getXdiEndpointUrl();

* Exceptions in xdi2.client were refactored:
Xdi2DiscoveryException, Xdi2ClientException, Xdi2AgentException

* XdiLocalRoot -> XdiCommonRoot

* contributorXris -> contributorAddresses

* The XdiMetaClass class is removed. 
This represented the XDI context nodes [#] and [$], which are not valid anymore.
If you have these context nodes in a graph, you should remove them before upgrading the code.
