release 0.7 ("Belgrade")
========================

* Timestamps.setContextNodeTimestamp() -> Timestamps.setTimestamp()

* XDIConstants.XDI_ADD_VARIABLE -> XDIConstants.XDI_ADD_COMMON_VARIABLE

* Updated variable support in parser and class hierarchy; variables are now nested classes.

* Remove XDIAddressUtil.findXDIAddress(), introduced XDIAddressUtil.extractXDIAddress()

* To move away from old "XRI" terminology, classes were renamed, e.g.:
XDI3Segment -> XDIAddress
XDI3SubSegment -> XDIArc
XDI3Statement -> XDIStatement

* To move away from old "XRI" terminology, methods were renamed, e.g.:
Message.setLinkContractXri() -> Message.setLinkContractXDIAddress() 

* To move away from old "XRI" terminology, constants were renamed, e.g.:
XRI_S_* -> XDI_ADD_*
XRI_SS_* -> XDI_ARC_*

* Use of the URL class instead of String in discovery:
String xdiEndpointUri = xdiDiscoveryResult.getXdiEndpointUri();
->
URL xdiEndpointUrl = xdiDiscoveryResult.getXdiEndpointUrl();

* Exceptions in xdi2.client were refactored:
Xdi2DiscoveryException, Xdi2ClientException, Xdi2AgentException

* XdiLocalRoot -> XdiCommonRoot

* contributorXris -> contributorAddresses

* The XdiMetaClass class is removed. 
This represented the XDI context nodes [#] and [$], which are not valid anymore.
If you have these context nodes in a graph, you should remove them before upgrading the code.
