Release Notes 0.7
=================

* Literal -> LiteralNode, and implements Node

* setDeepRelation, setDeepLiteral, etc removed, instead do setDeepContextNode(..).setRelation(..)

* To move away from old "XRI" terminology, classes were renamed, e.g.:
XDI3Segment -> XDIAddress
XDI3SubSegment -> XDIArc
XDI3Statement -> XDIStatement

* To move away from old "XRI" terminology, methods were renamed, e.g.:
Message.setLinkContractXri() -> Message.setLinkContractXDIAddress() 

* To move away from old "XRI" terminology, constants were renamed, e.g.:
XRI_S_* -> XDI_ADD_*
XRI_SS_* -> XDI_ARC_*

* Use of the URL class instead of String in discovery:
String xdiEndpointUri = xdiDiscoveryResult.getXdiEndpointUri();
->
URL xdiEndpointUrl = xdiDiscoveryResult.getXdiEndpointUrl();

* Exceptions in xdi2.client were refactored:
Xdi2DiscoveryException, Xdi2ClientException, Xdi2AgentException

* XdiLocalRoot -> XdiCommonRoot

* contributorXris -> contributorAddresses

* The XdiMetaClass class is removed. 
This represented the XDI context nodes [#] and [$], which are not valid anymore.
If you have these context nodes in a graph, you should remove them before upgrading the code.
